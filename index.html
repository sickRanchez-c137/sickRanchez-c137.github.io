    <li> <a href="https://github.com/sickRanchez-c137/fileMute">File Mute Project</a> </li>
    <p align-text="centre">File Mute project hides the information inside the file. The initial version V1 changes the magic number of file and changes the extension of file. Encryption and password based protection is planned next in V2. V3 will implement compression.</p>
    <li> <a href="https://github.com/sickRanchez-c137/Chekov">Chekov</a> </li>
    <p align-text="centre">Chekov is a writer much like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Chekhov">Anton Chekov</a>. However, Chekov can learn to write stories from any other writers as well.</p>
